# Supermoduli Space of Super Riemann Surfaces

This file defines the supermoduli space 𝔐_{g, n_NS, n_R} of super Riemann surfaces
using the supermanifold infrastructure from `Supermanifolds/Supermanifolds.lean`.

## Mathematical Background

### Super Riemann Surfaces

A super Riemann surface (SRS) is a (1|1)-dimensional complex supermanifold
with a superconformal structure: a rank (0|1) distribution D ⊂ T with [D,D] = T/D.

### The Supermoduli Space 𝔐_{g, n_NS, n_R}

The supermoduli space parametrizes super Riemann surfaces of genus g with:
- n_NS Neveu-Schwarz punctures (each contributes (1|1) to dimension)
- n_R Ramond punctures (contribute differently due to spin structure)

As a supermanifold, 𝔐_{g, n_NS, n_R} has the structure of a locally super-ringed space
with structure sheaf consisting of supercommutative superalgebras.

### Dimension Formula (to be proven)

For g ≥ 2 with n_NS NS punctures and no Ramond punctures:
  dim 𝔐_{g, n_NS} = (3g - 3 + n_NS | 2g - 2 + n_NS)

The proof requires:
- Deformation theory of super Riemann surfaces
- Riemann-Roch for spin bundles (K^{3/2})
- Analysis of the tangent complex

### The Projection Π : 𝔐_g → M_g

There is a forgetful map sending a SRS to its reduced (underlying) Riemann surface.
The fiber over [Σ] ∈ M_g parametrizes superconformal structures on Σ.

### Non-Projectedness (Donagi-Witten)

For g ≥ 5, the supermoduli space 𝔐_g is NOT projected, meaning it cannot be
expressed as Π(M, E) for a vector bundle E → M. The obstruction lives in
H¹(M_g, Sym²E) where E is the odd tangent bundle.

## The Supermoduli Space as a Supermanifold

We define the supermoduli space 𝔐_{g,n} using the `Supermanifold` structure.
The dimension is NOT part of the definition - it must be proven from deformation theory.

/-- Data for the supermoduli space of genus g super Riemann surfaces with n NS punctures.

    This structure packages the data needed to construct the supermoduli space
    as a supermanifold. The dimension is NOT assumed - it must be proven.

## Projectedness and the Donagi-Witten Theorem

A supermanifold is **projected** if it is isomorphic to Π(M_red, E) for
some vector bundle E → M_red, where the structure sheaf is ∧•E*.

For the supermoduli space, projectedness fails for g ≥ 5.
-/

/-- A supermanifold is projected if its structure can be split as Π(M, E).

    Mathematically, M is projected iff:
    - There exists a vector bundle E → M_red of rank dim.odd
    - M ≅ Π(M_red, E) as supermanifolds (i.e., O_M ≅ C^∞ ⊗ ∧•E*)
    - Equivalently, the nilpotent filtration on O_M admits a global splitting

    The obstruction to projectedness lives in H¹(M_red, Sym²E).

    **Full definition** (requires infrastructure to be developed):
    M is projected iff there exists:
    1. A vector bundle E → M.body of rank dim.odd
    2. A sheaf isomorphism O_M ≅ C^∞_{M.body} ⊗ ∧•E*
       compatible with the superalgebra structures

    This is equivalent to the vanishing of the obstruction class in H¹(M.body, Sym²E).

    For now, we axiomatize this as an abstract predicate. The concrete definition
    requires vector bundle and sheaf isomorphism infrastructure. -/

  -- The full definition requires:
  -- 1. Vector bundle infrastructure: E → M.body of rank dim.odd

  -- These will be developed in the supermanifold infrastructure.

/-- The obstruction cohomology group for splitting/projection.

    From Donagi-Witten (arXiv:1304.7798), Section 2.2.1:
    The first obstruction class ω₂ lives in
      H¹(SM_g, Hom(∧²T⁻𝔐_g, T⁺𝔐_g))
    where T⁺ and T⁻ are the even and odd parts of the tangent bundle.

    Since T⁺𝔐_g restricts to T_{SM_g} on the reduced space, and T⁻𝔐_g = E,
    this becomes H¹(SM_g, T_{SM_g} ⊗ Sym²E*).

    The class ω₂ is an invariant of the supermanifold and obstructs both
    splitting AND projection (no choice of trivialization affects it). -/

/-- The first obstruction class ω₂ for projectedness.

    From Donagi-Witten: ω₂ ∈ H¹(SM_g, Hom(∧²T⁻, T⁺)) is the primary

/-- **Donagi-Witten Theorem 1.1** (arXiv:1304.7798):
    For g ≥ 5, the supermoduli space 𝔐_g is NOT projected.

    **Proof strategy** (from the paper):
    1. Show that 𝔐_{2,1} (genus 2 with one NS puncture) is not projected (Theorem 1.2)
    2. Construct an embedding of a cover f̃M₂,₁ → 𝔐_g for g ≥ 5
    3. Use the Compatibility Lemma 2.12 to deduce ω₂(𝔐_g) ≠ 0

    The key technical ingredient is that the normal bundle sequence for the
    embedding f̃M₂,₁ → 𝔐_g splits, allowing the obstruction to transfer.

    **Physical interpretation**: Certain approaches to superstring perturbation
    theory that work in low orders (integrating over fibers of a projection)
    have no close analog in higher orders. -/

## The Odd Tangent Bundle

The odd tangent bundle E over M_g has fiber H⁰(Σ, K^{3/2}) at [Σ].
Its rank is 2g - 2 for g ≥ 2.
-/

/-- The odd tangent bundle over M_g.

    From Witten's notes (Section 2.2): For a split super Riemann surface,
    the odd part of the tangent space to M at Σ is
      T-M|_Σ = ΠH¹(Σ_red, T_{Σ_red}^{1/2})
    where T_{Σ_red}^{1/2} = K^{-1/2} is the spin bundle.

    By Serre duality, this is isomorphic to ΠH⁰(Σ, K^{3/2})*, the dual of
    the space of gravitino zero modes.

    The fiber at [Σ] has dimension 2g - 2 for g ≥ 2. -/

  fiberDim : base.points → ℕ

/-- The rank of the odd tangent bundle is 2g - 2 for g ≥ 2.

    **Proof**:
    - Fiber is H⁰(Σ, K^{3/2}) where K^{3/2} has degree 3(g-1) = 3g - 3
    - By Riemann-Roch: χ(K^{3/2}) = (3g - 3) - g + 1 = 2g - 2
    - By Serre duality: h¹(K^{3/2}) = h⁰(K ⊗ K^{-3/2}) = h⁰(K^{-1/2})
    - For g ≥ 2: deg(K^{-1/2}) = -(g-1) < 0, so h⁰(K^{-1/2}) = 0
    - Therefore rank = h⁰(K^{3/2}) = 2g - 2 -/

## The Dimension of H¹(M_g, Sym²E)

Computing this dimension is key to the Donagi-Witten theorem.
-/

/-- H¹(M_g, Sym²E) ≠ 0 for g ≥ 5.

    This is the key lemma for Donagi-Witten. The dimension of this cohomology
    group is computed using Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch on M_g.

    The computation requires:
    1. The Chern character of Sym²E (where E has rank 2g-2)
    2. The Todd class of M_g
    3. Integration over M_g (which has dimension 3g-3)

    The result is that dim H¹(M_g, Sym²E) > 0 for g ≥ 5, which implies
    the obstruction class ω₂ can be nonzero. -/

## Ramond Punctures

The supermoduli space with Ramond punctures has different structure.
Each Ramond puncture is a fixed point of the spin structure involution.
-/

/-- Data for supermoduli space with both NS and Ramond punctures.

    From Witten's notes (Section 4.2.3, equation 4.14):
    - Even moduli: 3g - 3 + n_NS + n_R
    - Odd moduli: 2g - 2 + n_NS + n_R/2

    Key constraints:
    - n_R must be even (from the degree constraint on the spin bundle)
    - NS punctures contribute (1|1) to the dimension
    - Ramond punctures contribute (1|1/2)

    The Ramond punctures correspond to divisors (not points) where the
    superconformal structure has special behavior. -/

# Weak Homotopy Equivalences

This file defines the induced map on homotopy groups and the notion of weak homotopy equivalence
for pointed topological spaces.

## Main Definitions

* `PointedTopSpace.inducedGenLoop` - The induced map on generalized loops
* `PointedTopSpace.inducedπ` - The induced map on homotopy groups
* `PointedTopSpace.IsWeakHomotopyEquivalence` - A map inducing bijections on all π_n

## Mathematical Background

For a pointed continuous map f : (X, x₀) → (Y, y₀), we get induced maps:
- On GenLoops: γ ↦ f ∘ γ
- On homotopy groups: [γ] ↦ [f ∘ γ]

A weak homotopy equivalence is a map f such that the induced map on π_n is a bijection
for all n ≥ 0.
